Microsoft Stock Price Analysis and Forecasting

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting Microsoft stock prices using time series modeling techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of statistical models to predict future stock prices.

Features

Data Cleaning & Processing: Load and preprocess Microsoft stock price data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, seasonality, and statistical properties.

Time Series Modeling:

Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for predictive modeling.

Exponential Smoothing for trend analysis.

Model Evaluation:

Assess model performance using residual analysis.

Validate predictions with historical data.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Statsmodels (Time Series Analysis)

Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and implement forecasting models on Microsoft stock prices. The project provides insights into short-term price movement predictions based on historical data trends.

Notes

The models presented are for educational and analytical purposes only. Stock market forecasting is inherently uncertain, and real-world investment decisions should be based on comprehensive financial analysis.
